During this time, Netflix was going through the same set of challenges like everyone else, but their user base\nwas growing and there was an early bet done by Reed Hastings to pivot the company's future from the DVD business (which\nwas still the biggest revenue maker) to Streaming. If the bet proved successful, the potential growth of streaming would\nbe a really large scale.
