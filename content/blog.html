It has
tremendous benefits both from a business and technical perspective due to its fundamental characteristics of agility,
scalability, and resiliency.</p><p>However, implementing microservices are hard! The inherently distributed nature of this architectural pattern introduces
complexity across multiple areas especially around Transaction Management, Data Consistency, and Process Automation. In
a distributed system, Business Transactions can span across multiple services. Since we no longer have the ability to
run a single ACID transaction, it requires careful coordination across these services to ensure that you have a
consistent and reliable system at the end of a business process.</p><p>Solutions to solve this ‚Äúcoordination‚Äù problem have led to the rise of a new set of application patterns that can be
broadly classified into two main groups - Choreography and Orchestration.</p><p>Let us tackle the first group - choreography which advocates the usage of events as a coordination mechanism to complete
local tasks within each microservice involved in an end-to-end business transaction. Each microservice is responsible
for its local execution of the transaction resulting in the publishing of events that other microservices react to and
then execute their local transactions. In other words, a sequence of event subscriptions across various microservices to
complete a business transaction.</p><p>Using the ubiquitous ‚ÄúFlight Booking example to depict a choreographic approach.</p><p><img alt="Microservice Choreography" src="/content/assets/images/choreography-microservices-40940fb115e82b9deb4552a853bb0d48.png"> <center><em>Choreogrpahy</em></center></p><p>As seen the various microservices utilize events to interact with each other to complete the booking process flow.</p><p>The tendency to move towards choreography to implement business flows in a distributed environment is natural, the major
appeal being the autonomy that this pattern provides. As seen in the flight booking example below, each microservice
executes its local transaction and publishes events that are subscribed to by other microservices which in turn trigger
local transactions.</p><p>But as you start looking at it more closely, we realize that there is a relationship or a logical flow between the
subscriptions and that is where it starts to become problematic.</p><ul><li>To begin with, it becomes difficult to see the flow as it is embedded within code. In other words, the lack of
visibility into the process flows is a challenging aspect of choreography as you would need to reason over all the
various microservices to infer the flow. </li><li>It becomes extremely difficult to gauge the impact of a change within the flow
requiring coordinated deployment and hope that it works due to the inability to test it holistically (since each service
just does its own bit). </li><li>There is no systematic mechanism to report as well as action on technical/business metrics
associated with the process (e.g. SLAs, How much are we done with Process X ?).</li></ul><p>In short, with peer-to-peer choreography, it becomes harder to scale with growing business needs and complexities. It
does offer a low entry barrier but you completely lose sight of the larger-scale flow.</p><p>On the other side of the spectrum is the Orchestration approach which relies purely on a task-based approach to
coordinate and execute process flows. Generally, it is implemented using a central component that issues task-based
requests to the individual services, interprets response(s), and decides to proceed/terminate or complete the flow.</p><p>Going back to the Flight Booking problem, if the orchestration approach is adopted, it would be depicted like something
below.</p><p><img alt="Microservice Orchestration" src="/content/assets/images/orchestration-microservices-b6ba52d773ccd37c1fc84fa3cc52c75b.png">  <center><em>Orchestration</em></center></p><p>The orchestration approach does alleviate some of the problems that choreography poses - There is now complete process
visibility and traceability into the process flows, change impact is localized to the central component and it generally
becomes easier and quicker to debug issues as well as action on them.</p><p>However applying orchestration is easier said than done and while at first glance it looks easy, it does have a whole
set of challenges associated with its implementation.</p><ul><li>For example, how do we prevent the centralized component from being a single point of failure? </li><li>In addition to that, we would need to ensure that there are no business logic creeps into the component and it does what it is intended to do
i.e. just pure orchestration. </li><li>And finally, how do we provide reliable, resilient, and scalable orchestration services
since it forms such a critical piece of the infrastructure.</li></ul><p>In short, we would need to build a distributed orchestration engine. And building one is not easy! Like any other piece
of infrastructural software, it is always prudent to utilize a purpose-built tool. And it holds true in the case of a
distributed orchestration engine too.</p><p>Introducing Conductor which was built to help orchestrate microservices based process flows at Netflix.</p><ul><li>Conductor provides a clean task-based API backed by a distributed server ecosystem to create a highly efficient and
scalable distributed orchestration engine. </li><li>It uses a well-structured DSL mechanism to help define process flows across microservices. </li><li>It provides full operational control over process flows including operations for pause/resume/retry and a
user interface to visualize, replay and search the flows. </li><li>Not to mention the fact that it is battle-tested for scale at Netflix volumes running millions of concurrent process flows.</li></ul><p><img alt="Netflix Conductor Architecture - Orkes" src="/content/assets/images/netflix-conductor-architecture-orkes-cbb66518714c62a1ecdac83b71129a69.png">  <center><em>Netflix Conductor Architecture</em></center></p><p>To conclude, the choice of orchestration over choreography to help run your process flows across microservices is a safe
one. However, it would be advisable to use a purpose-built engine like Netflix Conductor to help implement your
orchestration needs. The implementation is complex especially in a distributed system and Conductor helps abstract all
the technical and infrastructural complexities associated with orchestration helping you focus on your business code.</p><p>The adoption and usage of Conductor have exploded over the past few years since it was first released. Organizations
rely on Conductor to help implement reliable, scalable, and resilient Microservices-based applications utilizing a
robust distributed orchestration engine. From powering complex loan origination processes at a leading Financial
Institution to enabling India‚Äôs largest food delivery platform to assist sales at a large real estate brokerage company,
the range of use cases that Conductor supports is broad.</p><p>And that is precisely why we started Orkes! Orkes brings to market an enterprise-grade, cloud-hosted, fully managed
version of Netflix Conductor offering full compatibility with the open-source version along with tiered support.</p><p>Early access to the platform is now available for interested

Age of the Monoliths. It was very common to have large companies
run critical pieces of their software on large boxes. Scaling was only vertical. Single points of failure were common
scenarios that developers and operations often had to deal with. We have all heard stories of companies having
multi-hour , even multi-day outages. Social media wasn&#x27;t a thing back then, so you usually heard it on news sites or by
word of mouth.</p><p><img alt="Netflix" src="/content/assets/images/netflix-n-78ecf682a459d31b4786c33a9abfc609.jpg"> </p><header><h1>Netflix, AWS and Microservices</h1></header><p>As companies grew bigger and the web market grew bigger (remember Web 2.0?), they soon realized the need for redundancy
and horizontal scaling. This led to on-prem data centers. As companies started to grow, more than 30% of companies&#x27; time
and resources went into managing these data centers. That was a significant bit of distraction and lack of focus on the
core business of the company. Around 2006, Amazon saw this opportunity and created AWS, starting with their EC2
services. During this time, Netflix was going through the same set of challenges like everyone else, but their user base
was growing and there was an early bet done by Reed Hastings to pivot the company&#x27;s future from the DVD business (which
was still the biggest revenue maker) to Streaming. If the bet proved successful, the potential growth of streaming would
be a really large scale. And if that happened, the company had to be focused on the core of that business (Content
Acquisition, Personalization, Content Creation, Streaming etc. at planet scale) and not spend their resources on
building a world class cloud infrastructure. The decision was made to move completely to AWS.</p><p><img alt="AWS" src="/content/assets/images/1024px-Amazon_Web_Services_Logo-84d24e4e1708dc95aacf8e2abe1666cd.png"></p><header><h1>Poster Child of Cloud Computing</h1></header><p>Netflix was the very first company of its size to operate completely in the cloud. The whole paradigm shift in building
scaling applications using microservices architecture came out of this. Netflix became the poster child of cloud
computing. In the early days, AWS tooling wasn&#x27;t as rich as what you see today. Netflix built out a lot of this, open
sourced it. Understandably, Amazon adopted a lot of these principles and made it available on the AWS platform.</p><header><h1>Golden Era of Microservices - The Beginning</h1></header><p>The next 10 years and counting were the golden years of cloud computing and adoption of microservices architecture.
Azure, GCP and other providers followed suit as this industry blossomed. This also led to the birth of many startups in
this microservices space. Traditionally, what used to be done using desktop software, was now moving to the cloud.
Checkpoint became Z-Scaler, Tape drives became S3. Every segment of computing was now done in the cloud.</p><header><h1>Microservice Orchestration</h1></header><p>This explosion in microservices was natural, given the move to the cloud, but then led to another interesting problem,
Orchestration challenges. Things that were typically done by simple function calls in monolith systems became harder to
do in the cloud. There were new dimensions to deal with, network fault tolerance, distributed transactions, service
discovery and many more. It isn&#x27;t uncommon today to have more microservices than people in a company. This is true
regardless of the size of the company. Netflix, being the pioneer of microservices architecture saw this problem first.
To solve these orchestration challenges, there were several homegrown one off solutions, including peer to peer
orchestration solutions, orchestration through messaging platform based solutions, using things like Kakfa. None of
these really solved the problems that came with the microservice explosion. Netflix conductor was created out of this
need.</p><p><img alt="Netflix Conductor" src="/content/assets/images/conductor-vector-x-6eb0193b86bc74c758560a14f1f6450d.png"></p><header><h1>The Birth of Conductor</h1></header><p>As Netflix was moving its business from DVDs to streaming, the initial catalogue on the services were mostly licensed.
Licensed content however, did not provide enough differentiation to its competitors, since everyone was trying to pay for
the same pieces of content, leading to a low margin, high cost business model. Netflix, made another big bet, marking
its entry into Original programming. After seeing early signs of success, Netflix made a push to become the largest
studio in the world. Conductor was born out of this need. Netflix developers were known for doings at breakneck speed,
using very low resources. The true 10x developer !. Doing this fast, doing it without re-architecting existing systems.
Conductor was built with this in mind. It was designed to fit brownfield applications. It was designed to be language
agnostic. It was designed for operational excellence. It was designed to debug and fix things fast, when systems fail.
The very first use case for conductor was to solve for a new type of content in Netflix. Interactive Content!. It
started with kids programming and eventually moved to the mainstream with movies like Bandersnatch (Black Mirror!!) With
time it found its footprint across the entire company, it is now the service of choice for microservice and workflow
orchestration.</p><p><img alt="Netflix OSS" src="data:image/png;base64,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"></p><header><h1>Open Source and Industry Usage</h1></header><p>While the focus of the company was to build the best streaming service in the world, it also led to the birth of several
great pieces of software. Netflix used a lot of open source software for its needs and also decided to contribute
towards it. Netflix OSS initiative was a part of this effort. Conductor was built as a general purpose orchestration
engine. It helped Netflix solve critical problems in the microsservices space and it became a natural fit for Netflix
OSS.</p><p>Open Sourcing Conductor enabled several large and popular companies like Tesla, GitHub, Redfin and many more, to not
just use Conductor but also contribute back to it. Conductor, being built as a general purpose, language and cloud
agnostic engine further accelerated its adoption. Today, it is the software of choice, when it comes to microservice and
workflow orchestration.</p><p><img alt="Orkes" src="/content/assets/images/orkes-logo-35a5e6d8ea051e8c0c059c256b2595f5.png"></p><header><h1>Orkes</h1></header><p>The industry in general, lagged the adoption of this microservices architecture by around five years after Netflix made
the big move. As these companies and newer ones continue to adopt this paradigm, orchestration challenges that Netflix
faced early on, are now becoming a burning problem in the industry. Just like AWS saw an opportunity and doubled down on
it, in the infrastructure space, Orkes is doing the same in the orchestration space. Orkes‚Äô mission is to continue to
build a world-class, highly reliable orchestration service. The founding team of Orkes also comprises the original
founding team of Netflix Conductor. <a href="https://orkes.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Microservices and Workflow Orchestration at scale">Learn more about Orkes</a></p><p><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/orkes-conductor/shared_invite/zt-xyxqyseb-YZ3hwwAgHJH97bsrYRnSZg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Join the Conductor Slack Community">Join the Orkes Conductor Slack community here</a></p><p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/Orkes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Apply to Jobs at Orkes">Want to work at Orkes?</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_2ga9 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/content/blog/tags/netflix-conductor">Netflix Conductor</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/content/blog/tags/orkes">Orkes</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/content/blog/tags/conductor">Conductor</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/content/blog/tags/genesis">genesis</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/content/blog/tags/microservices">microservices</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/content/blog/tags/2021">2021</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/content/blog/welcome">Welcome to Orkes Conductor Blogs</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_291c margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-02T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 2, 2021</time> ¬∑ One min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_1R69"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/boney9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_1yU8" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/D5635AQGACYt5bMQdHg/profile-framedphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1641376945125?e=1641999600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=-bCzlO-gftanQLIQxiyCjSA8mLfYERHDBrUnARxJRGo" alt="Boney Sekh"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/boney9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Boney Sekh</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">CTO</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_1R69"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/nohup23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_1yU8" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQEHWy5icFieCw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1516312651412?e=1647475200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=q-anYjIu64_kfK4Oxcuye52d7q5eIZzU5EMK-_ClVkc" alt="Jeu George"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/nohup23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jeu George</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">CEO</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Welcome to Orkes Conductor Blogs.
