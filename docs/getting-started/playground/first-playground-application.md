# Creating your First Conductor Workflow in the Playground

With our playground, building and testing applications is easy!  Walk through this tutorial to see how easy it is to get started with application development in our playground.

We'll closely follow the [Building your First Workflow](../run/running-first-workflow) tutorial.  The code for the worker can be found on [Github](https://github.com/orkes-io/orkesworkers).

## Sign up

Create an account at [Orkes Playground](https://play.orkes.io) with your Google account or email account.  You'll be redirected into the playground.

## Workflow definition

To define a workflow in Orkes Playground, click ```Workflow Definitions``` from the left nav, and click the ```Define Workflow``` button.

Since this workflow is already created, we'll just copy/paste the JSON from the tutorial into the field and press save.  This will generate the workflow, and create the diagram:
